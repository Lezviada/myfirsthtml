<p style="position: relative;left: 2%;width:98%;"><font size="5">I am a student at Communications College No. 54, studying in the field of information security protection. 
There I study the legislation of the Russian Federation related to information security, I also study technical means for protection, and naturally software. 
My hobbies are books and games, although I also like to study everything that comes under my hand (You never know what or where you might be useful).</font></p>

 but the work was never finished although it was fun.</font></p>

while continuing to study at the university.</font></p>
